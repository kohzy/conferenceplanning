# Resources for Conference Planning

Here's a collection of good resources I found for the first-time conference planner.

* [How to Plan and Run a Great Conference Experience] (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/plan-and-run-a-great-conference) - Written by the organizer of HybridConf. there are some great tips in the comments too.
* [5 Tips To Reduce Conference Awkwardness] (http://blog.tito.io/posts/5-tips-to-reduce-conference-awkwardness/)
* [Look After Your Speakers] (http://blog.tito.io/posts/look-after-your-speakers/)
* [Conference organiser's handbook] (http://www.quirksmode.org/coh/)
* [Handbook for open-source software community conference organisers] (http://conference-handbook.readthedocs.org/index.html) - based on the experience of the organiser of DjangoCon and PyCon


###Comparable conferences
We're looking to host a one-day, single-track summit, bringing together designers and makers that hail from disciplines but share a common trait: they all create solutions (beyond therapies) that help autistic individuals.
* [Break Conference] (http://breakconf.org/) - 3 days, Belfast, across design disciplines
